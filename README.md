# Fivem-copradiofix
ðŸ”¹ Longer description (for README or server listing)  Cop Radio Fix is a lightweight standalone FiveM resource that removes the default police dispatch chatter from emergency vehicles. Sirens and lights still work as normal, but the background radio voices are completely muted. Perfect for custom police roleplay servers
